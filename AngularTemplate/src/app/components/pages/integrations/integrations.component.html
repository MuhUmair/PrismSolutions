                <h2>App-Based Integration</h2>
                <p>Most of the organizations across the globe use Salesforce to manage data, nurture leads and provide effective customer service. Furthermore, 
                various 3rd party apps are integrated with Salesforce to streamline the CRM with business applications and reduce the duplication of data. </p>

                <h2>Code-Based Integration</h2>
                <p>Besides apps, integration of Salesforce can also be done by using a programming language. One notable example is Apex which is a proprietary programming language that has

                    Most of the integration occurs on enterprise-level applications that cater to different layers such as Data, Business Logic, 
                    and User Interface to provide a greater level of quality, operational efficiency, and consistency to the users. 
                </p><br>
                <h4>A. User Interface Integration</h4>
                <p>A great way to permit users to enter multiple apps from a single platform. One such example is the Facebook app where the content is posted from several application vendors. </p>
                <h4>B. Business Logic Integration</h4>
                <p>It utilizes Apex web services for Inbound and Apex Callouts for Outbound to handle business logic across multiple applications and accomplish the end-to-end business process.  </p>
                <h4>C. Data Integration </h4>
                <p>It handles data synchronization needs using SOAP and REST APIs to allow single application in an enterprise to act as a major source of the specific business object. There is no need for coding, but it cannot implement any custom logic. </p>

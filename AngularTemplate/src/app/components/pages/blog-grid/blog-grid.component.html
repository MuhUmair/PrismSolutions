                <p>Prism Solutions implementation plan is a detailed, concrete plan, written in the checklist format. 
                    This list is compiled by our developers before starting work on each user story. It is a step-by-step instruction 
                    for performing each of the tasks prescribed by the engineer for himself or for other developers.  
                <p>Then we look at each deliverable and define the series of tasks that must be completed to accomplish each one. For each task, we determine the amount of time it 
                        will take, the resources necessary, and who will be responsible for execution. </p>

                        project. The project manager will be one of your primary contacts and they will provide you with status updates, schedule meetings, communicate deadlines, and coordinate internal team meetings. Prism Solutions uses a combination of cloud based technologies and internal
                         procedures to ensure that you and your team are kept up to date with project progress in real time.

                            Our first step in the project will be to assess in more detail of system strategies, current data, and how you work. Based on our extensive
                             implementation experience, we know the crucial questions to ask to ensure we build an optimal project plan. We will spend time interviewing 
                             staff, reviewing your processes and data, and digging into the various systems you have in place. From those efforts we will be able to align 
                             the hours and services we have proposed here with the detail of exactly how we recommend the project proceed.  
                         </p>

                         <p>
                            We will start this process with a brief kick-off meeting to introduce the project participants and
                             review the plan. Then, we will conduct meetings with the organization’s stakeholders for this 
                             process to further clarify current processes and future goals. Stakeholders could include 
                             development or program staff, executive project sponsors, and the IT personnel managing the project. 
                             These meetings will be held online and, ideally, will be scheduled over the course of a few weeks. 
                             We anticipate two to three deep discovery meetings of 60 to 90 minutes each.  
                         </p>

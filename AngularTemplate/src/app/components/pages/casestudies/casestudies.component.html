                            <p>After nearly two decades in business, sales and leads generation at Bogie Investment Group, Inc. were stagnating. Despite a strong reputation and 
                                well-respected suite of real estate services, the company was still relying on the same outdated processes for capturing, nurturing, and converting

                                tech-oriented disruptors. It was finally time to modernize the sales and lead generation process. </p>

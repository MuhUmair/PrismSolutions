                    <p>
                        When a user uploads a document, Salesforce creates a record for that document and allows the user to 
                        extract data from selected pages of the document using an optical character recognition process that 
                        runs in the background. You can use action plan templates to automatically attach the scanned document 
                        to a document checklist item, assign it to a queue, or trigger a flow.
                    </p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The document management process begins when a user uploads a PDF, JPG or PNG file to Health Cloud. A user can select pages in this content document to extract data from with Einstein Form Reader.</li>
                        <li>To make sure users can see documents they have transformed, keep the Document Checklist Item related list in the Received Document layout.</li>
                        <li>A Received Document record is created every time a user uploads an image file and manipulates the uploaded file.</li>
                        <li>By default, the name of the Received Document is the name of the file that the user uploaded.</li>
                        <li>If you add a required custom field to the Received Document object, the field must have a default field value set. If it doesn’t, manual upload won’t work. </li>
                    </ul>

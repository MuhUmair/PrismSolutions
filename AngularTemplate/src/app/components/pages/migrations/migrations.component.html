                    First, we do individual or group interviews with interested parties to gather or find out their needs. Then, 
                    we will interpret the requirements, including those that contradict each other and prioritize them in an effort to 
                    ensure that the most relevant functionality is provided first.

                    Finally, in a detailed presentation, we will outline the priority business, functionality and system requirements, and finalize the alignment of business and application visions.

                <p>
                    In cases of lack of records in the CRM system, our experts offer initiate data cleansing and data deduplication. Based on the
                     clientâ€™s data volume and complexity, we migrate the data from other source systems using the latest tools.
